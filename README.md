A starter project for LD42, aimed at exploring different turn-based strategy game mechanics. At this point I've only
implemented two basic turn structures, but I hope to add more at some point in the future (no time now - jam starts
in 24 minutes).

You can control the demo scenes with the following controls:
 * W: Up
 * A: Left
 * S: Down
 * D: Right
 * Q: Previous Unit
 * E: Next Unit
